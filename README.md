# Ground-effect-results
File data_nonplanar_rotors.m contains the results obtained from the experimental test bench designed to analyse the ground effect on two pairs of inclined rotors.
Also included are Figures 11(a), 17(a) and 18 from the paper "Aerodynamic interactions of non-planar rotor pairs and model derivation in ground approach".
